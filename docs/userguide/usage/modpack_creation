# Creating Modpacks with FFMT

### Importing
First you'll have to have some mods enabled and applied to your game as these will be used to create the modpack.

### Creation
```
> ffmt mpc -o ~/mymodpack.ttmp2
Follow the creation wizard
```

Your modpack will now be saved to the location you specified.
