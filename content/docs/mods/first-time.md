This is only a recommended first time setup. 

You are not required to make use of the config file created by this application, as all required directories can be specified through commandline instead.

Note: Common directories will be displayed in the config file

[Important Directories - Examples!]({{< ref "configuration.md" >}})
## First-time setup

1. The first run will create the application's config file

	```
	> ./FFMT-LINUX
	```

2. Edit the config file with your editor of choice

	```
	> nano ~/.config/FFMT/config.cfg
	```

3. Create a backup of your clean index files

	```
	> ./FFMT-LINUX backup
	```

You are now ready to start modding the game.
