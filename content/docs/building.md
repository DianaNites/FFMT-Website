## FFMT
Open .sln file with monodevelop (or presumably Visual Studio) and build a release as you would.
All dependencies should be gotten automatically, and references are available in the reference directory.

## [xivModdingFramework](https://github.com/liinko/xivModdingFramework)
A precompiled version is available in References.
If you need to build the framework, ensure that C# Language Version is set to 7.2 in monodevelop.
